                            `Community support drives our growth. Instead of chasing venture capital that could inflate prices or compromise quality, we're building a sustainable, community-powered platform. Every purchase helps us expand our course library, bring in expert contributors, and develop new learning paths tailored to you. We're also moving to self-hosted, self-run systems to keep our content free from corporate control, ensuring we get full profits and can keep prices down-even in tough economic times. We produce constant deals, have really cheap and well produced and quality reviewed content, and do everything we can to make things affordable for us so we can for you Keep in mind, we don't want things cheap, we wan't them affordable as keeping it affordable allows it to keep its quality, and even better, keeps us from corporate sponsors drooling over the releases or anybody internally from having a financial incentive to drive harmful change.`
